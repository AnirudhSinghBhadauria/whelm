Just for a second assume you're a content creator on YouTube (I know most of you are). Don't you just think, there should be a tool which should give me each and every detail about my new videos like how audience perceived it, what they want, feedbacks from them, the overall sentiment in audience so that I can better my content?
</p><p>
Imagine uploading a video that you spent days creating - scripting, filming, editing - only to face the daunting task of manually sifting through hundreds or thousands of comments to understand what worked and what didn't. Between the "first" comments, the spam, and the emoji reactions, finding actionable feedback feels impossible. You're left wondering: Did my audience actually like this content? What specific aspects resonated with them? What should I change for my next video? And most importantly, how can I grow my channel based on what my viewers actually want?
</p><p>
**Content creation shouldn't be guesswork**. You shouldn't have to rely on basic metrics like views and likes to determine if your content strategy is working. What if you could have a personal analyst that processes every comment, extracts meaningful insights, and delivers clear recommendations directly to you?
</p><p>
**That's exactly what Whelm does!** ***Whelm*** is an intelligent analytics system designed to help content creators understand audience perception and improve their content strategy. By automating the collection and analysis of YouTube comments. Processing comments from videos published within the last week to offer timely feedback.
